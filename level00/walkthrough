We've started executing the binary to see what was asking.

It asked a password and if you were wrong the output was "Invalid Password!".

We've disassembled the binary before using:

objdump -d level00 and after gdb level00.

We found the scanf call and the cmp call:

0x080484e7 <+83>:	cmp    $0x149c,%eax

from here it was easy to guess that the password was "0x149c" that in decimals is 5276.

We've tried and "Authenticated!" we got the flag to get to level01.
